Setup (is done already):

To connect to meteor02,meteor03, meteor04 or meteor05 add these lines to ssh config file 
(on MacOS, located at /private/etc/ssh/ssh_config):

Host cwi-cluster
 HostName scilens2-ssh.da.cwi.nl
 IdentityFile [path to your private ssh key]
 user [username]
 ForwardAgent yes

Host meteor*
 ProxyCommand ssh cwi-cluster -W %h.scilens.private:%p
 user [username]


Then, before connecting, this command should be executed:
> ssh-add [path to your private ssh key]

Perhaps the permissions are not correct,
see https://medium.com/@maximbilan/ssh-keys-fixing-the-warning-unprotected-private-key-file-17fabdca7d3b



Then, to connect to the meteor server, just execute:
ssh meteor02
ssh meteor03
...etc


I have my own folder there, at /export/scratch1/tdo
There is also a shared folder (for me, Marco, Arkadiy), at /export/scratch1/shared

Every meteor has its own file system. So to run on multiple servers at once, we should add the executables on every server.
